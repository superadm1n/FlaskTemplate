<h1>Plugin Methodology</h1>
<p>Author: Kyle Kowalczyk
Intended Audience: Developers</p>
<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>This document outlines the methodology of plugins for this system. A plugin in its basic form is a flask blueprint,
the key difference is instead of just implementing a blueprint via flasks standard implementation using the Blueprint
class a plugin will use the Plugin class which is located at app/plugins/Plugin.py</p>
<h1>Why use Plugin Class over Blueprint?</h1>
<p>The Plugin class is what will hold data about the blueprint beyond what just the flask.Blueprint class needs to know.
This is mainly for things like route restriction and database modification scripts etc.</p>
<h1>Guidelines for creating plugins</h1>
<p>Each plugin must have an entrypoint in the <strong>init</strong>.py file that defines a plugin variable similar to below</p>
<pre><code class="lang-python">from app.plugins.Plugin import Plugin

plugin = Plugin(
    name=&#39;test_blueprint&#39;,
    import_name=__name__,
    url_prefix=&#39;/test&#39;,
    template_folder=&#39;templates&#39;,
    static_folder=&#39;static&#39;,
    access_roles=[&#39;test1&#39;, &#39;test2&#39;, &#39;test3&#39;]
)
</code></pre>
<p>This will allow the plugin to be created properly.</p>
<p>Each plugin must also have a routes.py file which contains an import for the plugin variable and the routes
for the blueprint, or at least an import for all of the routes in the blueprint. This will make sure the routes
are loaded into the application properly</p>
<h1>How to do common tasks when developing Blueprints</h1>
<h3>Restricting access to routes</h3>
<p>If your blueprint or parts of your blueprint need to restrict access. Plugins are supported to implement route
restriction in the following ways</p>
<h3>Decorating Routes</h3>
<p>In the plugin blueprint you may restrict access to a single route by using the @plugin.required_roles() decorator.
the required_roles decorator takes an unlimited amount of string arguments that correspond to the role names that
the user needs to be associated to for route restriction.</p>
<h3>Internal Implementation:</h3>
<p>The Plugin class also presents a way for the developer to implement a different way of internal authentication by
presenting the current_user_has_roles() method. This method returns true if the user is associated with any
of the roles that you pass into it. It takes an unlimited number of standard string arguments. This allows you 
to decorate a function with @plugin.before_request so before every request that routes to this blueprint your
function runs and inside that function you can implement your access control by calling plugin.current_user_has_roles()
which will give you True False if the user has or does not have an association to that role.</p>
