                                                 Overview
This document outlines the methodology of plugins for this system. A plugin in its basic form is a flask blueprint,
the key difference is instead of just implementing a blueprint via flasks standard implementation using the Blueprint
class a plugin will use the Plugin class which is located at app/plugins/Plugin.py

                                    Why use Plugin Class over Blueprint?
The Plugin class is what will hold data about the blueprint beyond what just the flask.Blueprint class needs to know.
This is mainly for things like route restriction and database modification scripts etc.
